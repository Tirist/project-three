# Cloud Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status of the Google Cloud Run deployment and GCS storage implementation for the Stock Evaluation Pipeline.

## Deployment Details

### Cloud Run Service
- **Service URL**: https://stock-pipeline-128517367937.us-central1.run.app
- **Project**: industrial-keep-467717-b7
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed and Running

### GCS Storage Configuration
- **Bucket**: project_three_1
- **Storage Provider**: GCS (Google Cloud Storage)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Data is being saved to GCS

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Flask web server for Cloud Run deployment
- [x] GCS storage backend implementation
- [x] Docker containerization with Flask
- [x] Google Cloud Storage package integration
- [x] Cloud Run deployment
- [x] API endpoints (health, status, run pipeline)
- [x] Environment variable configuration
- [x] GitHub branch backup (cloud-implementation)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- [ ] Path coordination between pipeline steps in cloud environment
- [ ] File path resolution between local and GCS storage
- [ ] Test environment path mismatches

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Service account credentials configuration
- [ ] Production data flow validation
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET https://stock-pipeline-128517367937.us-central1.run.app/
```

### Status
```bash
GET https://stock-pipeline-128517367937.us-central1.run.app/status
```

### Run Pipeline
```bash
POST https://stock-pipeline-128517367937.us-central1.run.app/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mode": "test|prod|full",
  "storage_provider": "gcs|local|s3|azure"
}
```

## Local Development

### Switch to Cloud Implementation Branch
```bash
git checkout cloud-implementation
```

### Test Locally
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build --target production -t stock-pipeline:latest .

# Run locally
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 stock-pipeline:latest

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

### Deploy to Cloud Run
```bash
# Tag and push to GCR
docker tag stock-pipeline:latest gcr.io/industrial-keep-467717-b7/stock-pipeline:latest
docker push gcr.io/industrial-keep-467717-b7/stock-pipeline:latest

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy stock-pipeline \
  --image gcr.io/industrial-keep-467717-b7/stock-pipeline:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Configuration Files

### Cloud Settings
- **File**: `config/cloud_settings.yaml`
- **Storage Provider**: GCS
- **Bucket**: project_three_1

### Environment Variables
- **ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY**: Configured in Cloud Run
- **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**: Needs service account setup

## Next Steps

1. **Service Account Setup**: Configure Google Cloud service account credentials
2. **Data Flow Validation**: Verify data is properly stored in GCS bucket
3. **Path Coordination Fix**: Resolve file path issues between pipeline steps
4. **Production Testing**: Full end-to-end testing in production environment
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement monitoring and alerting
6. **Merge to Main**: Once fully tested, merge cloud-implementation branch to main

## Branch Strategy

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **cloud-implementation**: Cloud deployment work in progress
- **feature branches**: Individual features and fixes

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the cloud implementation:
1. Stay on main branch for local development
2. Use cloud-implementation branch for testing
3. Revert to previous stable version if needed
4. Continue development on main branch
